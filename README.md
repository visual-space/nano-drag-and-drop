**This is WORK IN PROGRESS. It is far from being released so don't bother to check this project for the moment.**

## Installation and usage

Download latest package from npm: 

    npm i nano-drag-and-drop --save

Require once in the `main.ts` file. One import is enough to register the global methods and the typescript definition.

    import nss as 'nano-drag-and-drop'
